    <h1>Gigiau - Your data and privacy</h1>
    <p>Thank you for contributing to Gigiau.</p>
    <p>Gigiau is an aggregation website that shows lots of events
        that are happening in the local area. It automatically
        picks up event listings from venues' and promoters' websites
        and Facebook pages.
    </p>
    <p>We obtain the agreement of the owners of the websites and
        Facebook pages before picking up their event data.
    </p>
    <h2>If you look at the events on Gigiau.uk</h2>
    <p>
        If you're just looking at the Gigiau website, we don't ask or keep any information about you at all. Your
        preference of language is kept on your own device, and not uploaded to our server.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do count the frequency of access to our data,
        but we don't track the usage of individual users.
    </p>
    <h2>If you're an events promoter</h2>
    <h3>If you manage a Facebook page</h3>
    <p>
        You can advertize events on the Events tab on your page.
        If you add your page to our poll list, Gigiau will then
        automatically look at your events list once every hour.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can remove your page from our list at any time.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We'll keep your Facebook ID securely on our server.</li>
        <li>We'll download your Facebook events and show them on our website,
            each with a link to your event page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>If you have a website with an events page</h3>
    <p>We can arrange, with your agreement, to pick up events from there.</p>
